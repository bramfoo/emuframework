To start FreeDOS Edit, type ''edit'' at the command line.
If your mouse does not work in the emulated environment, you can access menu items using the Alt-key plus the highlighted letter in the menu option. For example, type Alt-F to open the File-menu, Alt-E to open the Edit menu, etc. Sometimes, F10 needs to be pressed to bring the focus back to the current level.
For help, press F1.
