Emulation Framework
The Emulation Framework offers a convenient way to open old digital files and run programs in their native computer environment.
The EF supports emulators for the x86 computer platform, Commodore 64, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro and Thomson.
For more information, please visit http://emuframework.sourceforge.net/

This is a migration of the subversion repository of the Emulation Framework. It includes the full history and tags from revision r0 up
until revision r340 (dated 2012-04-12).
Note that a number of files larger than 100MB (notably the Xubuntu and Puppy distributions originally included) had to be removed
due to GitHub quota restrictions. This was done using The BFG (http://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/), and any relevant history has
been adjusted accordingly.

The original subversion repository can be found at http://sourceforge.net/p/emuframework/code/HEAD/tree/
