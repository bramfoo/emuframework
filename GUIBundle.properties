  Edit the addresses of the emulator- and software-archive. <br><br> \
  They're supposed to be entered as follows: <b>http://ADDRESS:PORT/ARCHIVE</b>,  \
  where <b>ADDRESS</b> is the name of the server running the webservice(s) (this  \
  could also be an IP address!), <b>PORT</b> is the port number the service is \
  listening on, and <b>ARCHIVE</b> the name of the service.<br><br> \
  Examples: <ul><li><b>http://services.kb.nl:1234/softwarearchive</b></li> \

  <h2>Introduction</h2> \
  <p> \
  This wizard adds an emulator to the Emulator Archive. Beware that \
  some work in advance is needed: \
  <ul> \
    <li>the emulator needs to be locally installed;</li> \
    <li>a FreeMarker<sup>1</sup> template needs to be present in the root of the installation directory of the emulator.</li> \
  </ul> \
  </p> \
  <p> \
  For more information on how to create a proper FreeMarker template, \
  see their website<sup>1</sup> or look at the documentation of the \
  Emulation Framework<sup>2</sup>. \
  </p> \

    <li>http://emuframework.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</li> \
  </ol> \
  <html>

ea_add_emu_explanation=<h2>Step 1</h2> \
  <p>Add an emulator by filling in the appropriate information and \
  selecting a locally installed directory in which an emulator is installed. \
  In the root of this directory, a valid FreeMarker template should be present.</p>

ea_hw_explanation=<h2>Step 2</h2> \
  <p>Select one or multiple hardware platforms and disk image formats \
  for the emulator from the two boxes below.<br/> \
  Hold the Control-key to select multiple options.</p>

swa_confirm_commit=<html> \
  <h2>Please confirm the following changes to the Software Archive:</h2> \
    <ul> \
    <li>%s: <b>%s</b>;</li> \
    <li><b>%s</b> will run on the %s operating system: <b>%s</b>;</li> \
    <li>the disk images associated with <b>%s</b> will have <b>%s</b> as its platform and <b>%s</b> as its file system;</li> \
    <li>the zipped file containing <b>%s</b> and <b>%s</b> is located at: <b>%s</b>;</li> \
    <li>the file format <b>%s</b> will be associated with <b>%s</b>.</li> \
    </ul> \
  </html>

swa_explanation=<html> \
  <h2>Introduction</h2> \
  <p>This wizard allows you to add a new software application to the Software Archive and associate \
  it with a certain file format. You can also select an application that is already in the Software \
  Archive and associate <i>it</i> with the file format.</p> \
  <br /> \
  <p>The following is required:</p> \
  <ul> \
    <li>a zipped disk image containing the installed application and operating system<sup>1</sup>;</li> \
    <li>in case of associating the application with a file format which is unknown to the Emulation Framework, \
        you need to have an example file stored locally;</li> \
  </ul> \
  <ol> \
    <li>http://emuframework.sourceforge.net/documentation.html</li> \
  </ol> \
  <html>

swa_app_explanation=<h2>Step 1</h2> \
  <p>Select an existing application which you want to \
     associate with a certain file format, or create a new application.</p>

swa_app_os_explanation=<h2>Step 2</h2> \
  <p>On what operating system does the selected application run?</p>

swa_hw_and_fs_explanation=<h2>Step 3</h2> \
  <p>On what hardware platform, and file system, does \
     the operating system selected in the previous step run?</p>

swa_zip_explanation=<h2>Step 4</h2> \
  <p>Please point where the zipped image containing \
     the operating system and application is located on your local disk.</p>

swa_file_format_explanation=<h2>Step 5</h2> \
  <p>Select an existing file format that will be \
     associated with the application selected in step 1/5, or create \
     a new file format by pointing to a local file on your hard disk</p>
